"""Host-side choice between the two NAX prefill pipelines.

``pagedattention_nax.metal`` compiles a split pipeline, which skips bounds
checks on complete KV tiles of full 64-row Q blocks, and an unsplit one that
keeps the original single guarded loop.  Outputs are identical; only speed
differs.  The split pipeline speeds up full Q blocks but slows the guarded
tiles of partial blocks (a sequence's last block when its length is not a
multiple of 64, and decode rows), and a launch with only a few full blocks
does not fill the GPU enough to hide that.

The choice needs every sequence's query and KV length, which the kernel
dispatcher can only read from the GPU.  The attention context holds them on
the CPU, so the rule is evaluated here once per forward and passed down as
``nax_split_hint``. The D64-D256 thresholds were calibrated on an M5 Max
(BF16, block size 16). D512 uses two output slices to reduce the split kernel's live
accumulator state; short and partial-dominated launches keep the original loop.
